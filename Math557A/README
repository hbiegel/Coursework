This folder contains the code necessary to run simulations for the seasonally-forced SEIR epidemic model by Schwartz and Smith (1983).

Contents

bifurc_sim   : Uses the model and analysis of Schwartz and Smith (1983)
               to plot solutions to the seasonally-forced SEIR epidemic model
               near the period-doubling bifurction for measles-specific parameter values     
               
runSEIR     :  Implemenation of the SEIR model (not seasonally-forced)
               with measles-specific disease parameters; initial state currently set to
               the steady state solution of system
               
simModel    :  Plots seasonally forced period 1 solutions in the X-Z phase plane

plotFlu     :  Plots influenza data (weighted ILI) downloaded from the CDC FluView website 
               to demonstrate seasonality of the flu
